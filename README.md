Power BI Virtual Case Experience by PWC

In this virtual internship program, there were 4 major tasks that needed to be performed for gaining practical experience in learning PowerBI and also leveraging aspects of data visualization through dashboards and reports.

Task 1: Introduction to PowerBI and its trends.

Task 2: Examine the transparency through KPIs and insights of Call Center Data Trends and Analysis of a telecom company for the first quarter of the year.
  In this task, we were given a call centre dataset. The task is to analyze the call centre trends such as -
  
  a) Overall customer satisfaction
  
  b) Overall calls answered/abandoned
  
  c) Calls by time
  
  d) Average speed of answer, and
  
  e) Agent's performance
